                                        I am pleased to welcome all our students to the Claretian University Centre for Distance Learning & Continuing Education
                                        (CDLCE). I would like to extend a special welcome to all our families. I am honoured to be your director. Our goal in
                                        the CDLCE is to promote quality higher education from the comforts of our students’ and educators/lecturers’ homes.

                                        My belief is that everyone is entitled to further education if the interest and will are available irrespective of how
                                        far behind the person has been educationally. To me, all students can learn! Homes, offices, parks etc. are good sites
                                        for learning. Technology has made it possible to bring quality education at one’s doorsteps.
                                    </p>

                                        Technology has made it possible to bring quality education at one’s doorsteps. The Claretian University of Nigeria (CUN)
                                        has decided to take advantage of the technological innovation that exist to bring quality and affordable higher
                                        education to many via the Distant learning programmes.

                        <p>
                            As higher institutions are plagued with the Covid-19 pandemic and other related challenges, we need to discover how
                            to
                            take quality higher education to the doorsteps of all interested students. In a collaborative effort, we want all
                            our
                            students to thrive in everyday possible. My hope is that everyone can re-engage higher education in a less
                            stressful,
                            positive, and safe from their experiences with CUN distance Learning programmes.

                        <p>
                            Students’ success in Distance Learning are attributed to the relationships between their efforts, tenacity,
                            discipline,
                            and the Directorate. It has become exceedingly important that we make higher education more accessible and
                            affordable to
                            create a more civil environment of professionalism in all fields of endeavours. CUN’s Distance Learning programmes
                            will
                            provide green opportunities for all that were once lost in academic pursuit to be found.

                                <li>Above all, all programmes are PRACTICAL biased. This means that there is serious emphasis on the practical aspects
