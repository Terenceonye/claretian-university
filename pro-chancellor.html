                            <p>
                                In January 2016, the VII Provincial Chapter of Claretian Missionaries of East Nigeria unanimously adopted a resolution
                                directing that the “administration studies the possibility of establishing a University in Imo State”. (cf. Provincial
                                Chapter Document, 2016 p.41).
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Several possibilities were considered including a public-private-partnership University with Government of Imo State. In
                                2018, after exhaustive consultations with stakeholders and wise Counsel of the Superior General of Claretian
                                Missionaries, it was decided that the Province could pursue the pathway towards establishing a private University.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                The Academic planning Committee on the University established in 2015 was later constituted as the Project
                                Implementation Committee (PIC) in 2018. In 2021, the Claretian University of Nigeria was formally licensed by the
                                Federal Government as a private University with a take-off at the premises of the Claretian Institute of Philosophy
                                Nekede.

            <p>
                The overall decline in our educational system and the underlying moral values has become a major concern to the nation.
                The standards of education, discipline and morality have fallen to a point where a private sector approach is indeed the
                only way forward to ensure a sustainable future for the Nigerian youth. This dire situation has created a moral
                obligation on the part of the faith-based institutions, which underpins the establishment of the Claretian University of
                Nigeria, to leverage education as a tool for social transformation.
            </p>

            <p>
                Claretian University of Nigeria is a faith-based university that belongs to the Claretian University Education
                Foundation. Even though it operates under the supervisory framework of the National Universities Commission, it is
                expected as a private university to reflect certain unique features in its operations to keep abreast with the
                requirements of a strong Catholic university, a reputable centre of excellence whose products are truly worthy in
                character and in learning.
            </p>

            <p>
                I would like to express my deep appreciation to the Superior General of Claretian Missionaries for timely approval of
                the Claretian University of Nigeria project and patiently accompanying it to this critical stage through his delegate
                Rev Fr Henry Omonisaye, CMF and giving us the opportunity to be involved in this historic project as Pro-Chancellor.
