                            <h3>Message from the Vice Chancellor of the Claretian University of Nigeria</h3>
                            
                            <p>
                                In the Encyclical Letter of 1929, probably the most authoritative document on Catholic education; Pope Pius (X1) defined
                                education as the sacred task of forming the character of the child and aiding them to attain the purpose of existence.
                                It is stated in Can.795 of the Code of Canon Law 1983 that “education must pay respect to the development of the whole
                                person so that all may attain their eternal destiny and at the same time, promote the common good of society.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Children and young persons are therefore to be cared for in such a way that their physical, moral and intellectual
                                talents may be developed in a pleasant manner so that they may attain a greater sense of responsibility and a right use
                                of freedom and be formed to take an active part in social life.”
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                The Second Vatican Council declaration; that “true education is directed towards the formation of the human person in
                                view of his final end and the good of the society to which he will, as an adult, have a share” indeed calls for deep
                                reflection, at this time in the development of our dear nation, Nigeria.
                            </p>

            I must not fail to acknowledge the dedication of the esteemed members of the PIC, very busy men who brought their varied
            professional and academic experiences to bear on the work of the committee and who studiously kept assignments and
            turned up for meetings often at short notices travelling from different parts of Nigeria. On behalf of the PIC, I wish
            to express my profound gratitude to Mr. Chukwuemeka Okereke, the Chief Technical Innovation Officer (CTIO) of CUN for
            his unwavering commitment to this good cause. I am indebted to the Most Rev Dr Hilary Dachelem, CMF, Bishop of Bauchi
            and the first Pro-Chancellor of the Claretian University, for committing time and resources and with his unfailing
            presence in all meetings and trips connected with NUC.
        </p>

        <p>
            Finally, it is our hope and prayer that the Claretian University of Nigeria will be a niche institution able to serve
            the needs of its immediate environment and society and be a centre of global scholarship in the areas of specialization
            identified for it. That it becomes a new and positively focused conventional University that shall be totally dedicated
            to the training and education of a new Nigerian, to be entrenched with a new vision, with new value systems, new
            learning and working ethics and with a resolute commitment to the norms of excellence in Arts, Science and Technology
            disciplines.
        </p>

        <p>
            I hope you will join forces with the Claretian University of Nigeria to contribute to a brighter future for our
            children. Wishing you grace and Peace, I welcome you to the University of the third millennium.
