                            Trans-National Education (TNE) refers to the movement of people, programmes, providers, knowledge, ideas, projects
                            and
                            services across national boundaries. The term is often used interchangeably with “offshore education” and
                            “borderless
                            education”. Trans-National Education involves educational partnerships, developmental cooperation projects, academic
                            exchange programmes and commercial initiatives.

                                        It is the type of higher education that takes place in situations where the teacher, student, programme,
                                        institution,
                                        provider or course materials move across national jurisdictional borders. Trans-National Education may include
                                        higher
                                        education by public/private and not-for-profit/for-profit providers. It encompasses a wide range of modalities in a
                                        continuum from face-to-face (taking various forms, from students travelling to campuses abroad) to distance learning
                                        using a range of technologies including e-learning. It presents a wide range of opportunities such as increasing
                                        access
                                        to higher education and promoting strategic alliances between countries and regions.

                                        Trans-National Education has other benefits which include: International Security arising from bilateral
                                        relationships,
                                        maintenance of economic competitiveness and understanding across nations, spread of technologies, promotion of
                                        knowledge
                                        economy and creation of regional networks, as well as attaining international level in research and teaching.

                                        Nigeria has been a member of the World Trade Organization (WTO) since 1st January, 1995. All Members of the
                                        organization
                                        are party/signatories to the 1995 General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS), which was designed to increase
                                        trade
                                        liberalization. Education was also considered as an exportable service. The National Universities Commission (NUC)
                                        hopes
                                        to widen access and fully exploit the provisions of GATS for the benefit of Nigerians. An additional advantage of
                                        opening up the space for TNE is the opportunity it would afford to foster collaborations between stakeholders in the
                                        Nigerian University System and their counterparts in foreign countries.
