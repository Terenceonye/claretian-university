                                        The African environment is probably the least explored in terms of available resources. One needs to take a course to
                                        the plant world and abundant indigenous knowledge in Africa to discover untapped resources. This is no news any longer,
                                        but the manner in which our development in Africa is carried out has disconnected from the cultural, social, traditional
                                        determinants, thought processes, perspectives, and history of a continent that prides itself as the cradle of
                                        civilization in the world. 
                                    </p>
            
                                    <p>
                                        The civilization and first writings of the world came from Egypt-hieroglyphics-Africa. More
                                        than 80% of Africans depend on local wisdom and homeopathic medicine for example and more than 95% of Africans
                                        particularly survive and thrive on local wisdom.
                                    </p>
            
                                    <p>
                                        In Africa, people still consult traditional healers and rulers even when being attended to in conventional orthodox
                                        clinic, and even in the face global modernization, a lot local decisions in rural areas are based on culture, rituals,
                                        ethnography, ethno politics, traditional methods and perceptions in gender and settlements of disputes to name a few.
                                        Unfortunately, inadequate effort in transforming these vast African knowledge using simple low cost technologies built
                                        within the context of the culture, ecology and ethno-economics of Africa remains poor.

                            This, partly, due to the fact that even African scientists and intellectuals, unfortunately, have conflicting
                            interpretation of the African identity and so engrossed in western models and ideologies and call it western identity
                            that expresses and adulterates indigenous dignity with viewing as inferior. We stand at the opinion that science and
                            technology and indeed development strategies in Africa should be rooted in her ethnographical and cultural
                            characteristics yet uncompromising in global standards, thus giving us an edge at global markets.

                            Building upon the fact that our development in Africa should base on and benefit from her cultural, social, traditional
                            determinants, thought processes, perspectives, and history of a continent that prides itself as the cradle of
                            civilization in the world, some scientists across in collaboration with staff of Claretian University of Nigeria have
                            developed home grown technologies to control , prevent and treat different infectious and non infectious diseases,
                            improve agriculture and generate a healthy environment developed from the local knowledge and wisdom of Africa. The
                            Phytobiotechnology Research Foundation in Cameroon has demonstrated pilot technologies built and hinged on African
                            ecology ab initio.

                            Phytodisinfectants and Afrocentric technologies based on these concepts in 2008 which was published in the Unesco

                            published a compendium that captures indigenous knowledge technology in generating potable water. The book has been
